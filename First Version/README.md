# Pacman Game

Welcome to this exciting version of Pacman, where the game is played on a grid-based system. In this game, there are two arrays used to manage ghost movement and the rest of the game. The ghosts move randomly without any pathfinding, and if Pacman touches a ghost three times, he dies.

This game features a high score system that saves the highest score in the database. Moreover, to access the game, players must first log in or sign up. The login and sign up system is easy to navigate.
